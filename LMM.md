# The Basics of Linear mixed-effects models #

## What is LMM? ##
- LMM or mixed (effect) model or hirechical linear model is a statistical technique that is getting popularity in neuroscience and experimental psychology.
- An LMM describes the relationship between a response variable and other explanatory variables that have been obtained along with the response.
- At least one predictor must be categorical

## When do we use LMM? ##
- We can use LMM for a within-subject/within-group design, e.g., Participants respond to different tasks, and each task takes 80 trials. 
- Question: Instead of LMM, which statistics do we usually use for this designs?

## why do we use LMM over the other approach? ##
- The statistical assumption for LMM is more flexible
