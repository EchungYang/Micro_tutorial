## Welcome to the Micro-tutoria on Creating a Github Pages site


### What is a Github page?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. 

### Why a Github page?

- Free
- Good to start-with
- Easy to share publicly or privately (although the default is open to the public)
- Friendly with script/code/any project-based work
- Automatically saved 


### Why not a Github page?

- Not for commercial use e.g., online business, e-commerce site
- Not for any forms of transaction (finacially or other sensitive transactions like sending passwords)


### Three types of Github page

1. Project
Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection.

The below two are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

2. User 
  creating a resipotory under the name of `<username>.github.io`
3. Organisation 
  creating a resipotory under the name of `<organization>.github.io`
  
  Unless you want to use a custom domain


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EchungYang/Micro_tutorial/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
